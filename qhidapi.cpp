   \class QHidApi
   \brief \c QHidApi is a Qt wrapper class for the hidapi library from
  Signal 11. <http://www.signal11.us/oss/hidapi/>

   This wrapper class allows the use of QString, quint32 etc rather than the C
  style wchar_t* and unsigned int.

   The class maintains a list of one or more hid devices, any of which can be
  accessed using the id returned when the device is opened. If you have lost the
  device id, the reopen the device using the original vendow/product id's or the
  device path and QHidApi will return the original id.

   You can use enumerate to generate a list of available devices. The vendor and
  product id's can then be used to \c open() the devices.

   HIDAPI is a multi-platform library which allows an application to interface
  with USB and Bluetooth HID-Class devices on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. While
  it can be used to communicate with standard HID devices like keyboards, mice,
  and Joysticks, it is most useful when used with custom (Vendor-Defined) HID
  devices. Many devices do this in order to not require a custom driver to be
  written for each platform. HIDAPI is easy to integrate with the client
  application, just requiring a single source file to be dropped into the
  application. On Windows, HIDAPI can optionally be built into a DLL.

   Programs which use HIDAPI are driverless, meaning they do not require the use
  of a custom driver for each device on each platform.
